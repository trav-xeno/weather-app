# weather-app

This projects goal was to make a weather dashbaord. The user can search a city and get the day break down and weekly forecast as well.
Every search is saved under history and allows the user to use past searches.
I appraoched this porject knowing the limits in api calls I could make. So to make each call matter coded all the parts using dummy data to ensure functionality per part I added.
Even with this apporach I still ran out of calls at times. So debugging

## Javascript

I used vuejs for te main app driver for htis project.
I ran into a problem when it came to ajax calls inside vue app object, but learned of the fetch functions in pure javascript.
So I learned it and I like it more than jquery's \$.get easy to debug and mess with data.
The libraries used in this porject were momentjs, vuejs, and javascript fetch.

## CSS

Updating comming with a bit better lookin background and coloring choices. For tue most part his uses pure materialize.
If you are wondering about the icons I used openweathers icon url to get their icons. Each weather event had their icon code and all I did was put the code in the url and was added into page using vuejs binding to src of image tags.
